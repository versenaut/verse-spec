(Internal, informal, list of things that need to be improved in the spec)

1.1 Intro
DONE	- remove vr, use "shared 3d data"?
	- copy more from pdf
	- create new introduction section, mixing things from the three areas

1.2 About
	- licensing/IP

2.1 Perfect data
	- more in first paragraph, freedom of impl., come close to spec.
DONE	- simplify dataset sentence, avoid nesting :)
DONE	- remove sentence about particles

2.1/2.2/2.3 intro stuff
	- create new section from these, and also talk about point-to-point,
	  host and clients roles, and stuff
	- create new section about IDs and names, ID spaces, reserved names,
	- illegal id?

2.5
DONE	- remove "matrix"
	- linking changes, see R4
	- label the links
DONE	- missing image?
DONE	- light: remove type talk
DONE	- light: area lights controlled by linking to labelled geometry

2.6
DONE	- give numerical IDs for vertex and polygon layers (0 and 1 :)
DONE	- creases: 0 is smooth, max is sharp

2.7
	- reformat so table 2.3 is not a table?
DONE	- add enum tables for ramp and noise (more missing?)
	- describe normal falloff, bell curve distribution of random normal, kinda
DONE	- talk about purpose, i.e. per-point evaluation
DONE	- section about standard names ("color" and "displacement", perhaps "audio")
DONE	- displacement: average of rgb result, displacement along normal in geometry space
	- front and back need to be defined ("same as GL")

2.8
DONE	- coordinates are "screen-like", with (0,0) being top left corner. z goes "into paper"
DONE	- shorten to three-dimensional only, treat 2/1D as special cases
DONE	- restrict so 1D must be in X (with height=1)
DONE	- write about bitmaps being samples, filtering is ok

DONE	Link to API from data model text
* Link/specify required subscription from API calls
* Create overview of how numerical IDs are allocated/treated
