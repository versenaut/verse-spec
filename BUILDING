Building the Verse Specification Document ("the spec")

The spec is written in DocBook XML, with a lot of machine-
generated parts.

If you have all the tools required, a single "make" in the
top directory should build the document, in HTML format.

Tools needed are:

docbook2html	- DocBook processor used for main document
xsltproc	- General XSLT processor, used to generate
		  DocBook from custom XML documents by
		  applying various transforms. See protocol/
Batik		- SVG rasterizer (written in Java)
Java run-time	- to run Batik
dot		- Graph renderer, part of Graphviz
