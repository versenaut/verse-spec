    Building the Verse Specification Document


INTRODUCTION
The Verse Specification (often referred to here as just "the
spec") is written in DocBook XML, with a lot of machinegene-
rated parts. It has only been built on the author's Gentoo
Linux system; building it in e.g. Windows might be tricky.


BUILDING IT
The media/ directory holds various images, and need to be
built separately at the moment. This is mainly for performance
reasons; I want to be able to do "make clean" in the toplevel,
which holds all the HTML, without having that affect the images.
So, first enter media/ and run make in there. After a while,
various subdirs should be populated with PNG images.

Then, go back to the toplevel dir, and run make a second time.
This should enter protocol/, do various transforms there to
generate DocBook snippets, which are included by the main
"spec.docbook" document. The final result will be 200+ HTML
files in the toplevel, browse "index.html" to test the spec.


TOOLS
The following tools are required in order to build the spec:

docbook2html	- DocBook processor used for main document
xsltproc	- General XSLT processor, used to generate
		  DocBook from custom XML documents by
		  applying various transforms. See protocol/
Batik		- SVG rasterizer (written in Java)
Java run-time	- to run Batik
dot		- Graph renderer, part of Graphviz


FILENAME CONVENTIONS
The following suffixes are seen in this package:

.docbook	- Complete DocBook document, with proper
		  headers
.xml		- Custom XML document, usually lacking a
		  formal document type definition. Used to
		  e.g. describe the commands.
.snip		- Generated DocBook text, by processing XML
		  using XSLT. Not complete, must be included
		  in a proper document to work.
.dot		- Graphviz graphs, used for e.g. subscription
		  figures. Processed into SVG by "dot" tool.
.svg		- Structured Vector Graphics, often used as
		  source format for images.
.png		- Bitmap image data for inclusion in spec.
